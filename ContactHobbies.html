  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading a good book on your bed or in a park. 
      I always used to hate reading as a kid, that's because I was reading the wrong books.</li>
    <li>I love establishing and maintaining my aquariums. 
        There's nothing like that feeling of pure joy you get from looking at a new or re-done aquarium. 
        I enjoy watching my fish more than television!</li>
  </ul>
